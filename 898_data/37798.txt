"If we knew what it was we were doing, it would not be called research, would it?"
-Albert Einstein

[introduction]I am currently a [position]graduate student[/position] at [affiliation]NJIT[/affiliation]. My research interests are driven by my fascination with the way people use information to solve everyday problems (or create more information that no one ever uses). I am driven to examine and create tools that can assist people in the process of making sense of the glut of information around them.

On a personal note I am interested in [interests]using information technology to support grassroots economic development in underdeveloped nations[/interests]. I look foward to the day that we can truly begin to eliminate poverty in many parts of our world.[/introduction]

A little bit of verse

Does my haughtiness offend you?
Don't you take it awful hard
'Cause I laugh like I've got gold mines
Diggin' in my own back yard.
-Still I rise, Maya Angelou

I am a part of all that I have met
Yet all experience is an arch wherethrough
Gleams that untravelled world whose margin fades
Forever and forever when I move
-Ulysses, Alfred Lord Tennyson

I love thee freely, as men strive for Right
I love thee purely, as they turn from Praise
I love with a passion put to use
In my old griefs, and with my childhood's faith.
-How do I love thee?, Elizabeth Browning

Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death,
I will fear no evil: for thou art with me;
thy rod and thy staff they comfort me
-Psalm 23
