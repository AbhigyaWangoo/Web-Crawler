[introduction]I'm an [position]Assistant Professor[/position] at the [affiliation]University of British Columbia[/affiliation] (in Vancouver) where I am affilated with the [affiliation]Data Management and Mining group[/affiliation]. I finished my [phddegree]PhD[/phddegree] in the [phdmajor]database[/phdmajor] group in the [phdmajor]Computer Science and Engineering[/phdmajor] Department at the [phduniv]University of Washington[/phduniv][/introduction].


[resinterests]Research My research centers on (1) [interests]how data can be managed in situations where there are multiple databases[/interests] and (2) [interests]how to manage data that is currently not well supported by databases[/interests]. To that end, my students and I are currently exploring a number of topics, including managing data used in disaster response coordination, managing data in peer-to-peer networks, helping people who are building buildings to better manage their data, schema evolution, and managing metadata (i.e., data about data). Information about some of these topics can be found by looking at my publications.[/resinterests]
