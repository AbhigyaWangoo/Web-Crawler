If you are from industry looking for <b>consultation</b>, please read the section titled Consultative practice rules and norms (1996) herein, and my informal notes.

At the moment I am <b>not offering short-term projects</b> to students not enrolled in a regular program at IIT Bombay. Only if you are looking for at least a year-long position, send email with an ASCII resume. I am amazed at the number of people shooting me 2-month project requests despite this statement.

If you are an IIT student looking for a project within the scope of your program (Btech, DD, Mtech) please read these guidelines first.

The best way to contact me is to send mail to (please note that I am on a low-spam diet). Or you can call me at [contactinfo][phone]+91-22-2576-7716[/phone] or fax me at [fax]+91-22-2572-0290[/fax]. Please use <b>only email</b> to initiate a conversation with me if we haven't communicated before, unless it is an emergency. If you are visiting, here are directions to my office.[/contactinfo]

[resinterests]Research interests

[interests]Searching with entities and relations[/interests]
      I am interested in building new search systems that integrate type and role annotations with keyword matches, thereby exploiting lexical ontologies and entity taggers.

[interests]Integrating IR with databases[/interests]
      In the BANKS project, we added two broad paradigms of keyword search in graphs that can represent text embedded in relational or XML-like data. Watch this space for updates on our SPIN project.

[interests]The effect of search engines on the Web graph and page popularity[/interests]
      Search engines are influenced by the (in)degree of Web pages, but their ranked lists modulate page popularity and eventually their (in)degree, setting up a feedback to some degree. Might the evolution of the Web graph be influenced substantially by the existence of search engines? Is there a need to regulate monopolies? What are healthy economic objectives, and how to optimize them?

[interests]Focused crawlers to build topic-specific portals[/interests]
      A focused crawler collects a topic-specific subgraph of the Web by coupling classifiers and reinforcement learners with crawlers. An open-source focused crawler project was started at the Lab. for Intelligent Internet Research and is available now.

[interests]Mining hypertext to estimate topics and popularity[/interests]
      I built a hypertext classifier that uses the text in and links around a given Web page to label it with a topic. This was an early application of Markov networks to Web analysis. As a member of the IBM Clever Project, I worked on algorithms to analyze the links around a web page and the text in pages that cite the given page to assign it a measure of popularity.

[interests]Compiling and running parallel scientific programs[/interests]
      My PhD thesis was on the design and implementation of compilers and runtime systems for distributed memory multiprocessors.[/resinterests]
