[introduction]Amitabh Srivastava is a [position]Corporate Vice President[/position] of the Windows Live Core and a [position]Microsoft Technical Fellow[/position]. Srivastava's current efforts are focused on efficiently developing [interests]next generation cloud services[/interests].

Srivastava joined Microsoft in 1997 as a Senior Researcher and led the Advanced Development Tools group in Microsoft Research that investigated new techniques to build innovative tools and technologies to improve performance and quality of Microsoft software. His vision and energy led to the creation of the Programmer Productivity Research Center (PPRC) in March 1999, which he has led since its inception. Srivastava's PPRC group, now known as Center for Software Excellence (CSE), has produced several tools and technologies that are critical to Microsoft product groups. Srivastava and his team's work was highlighted in the Forbes magazine in May, 2003.

In January 2001, Srivastava became one of a select few to be named a Distinguished Engineer, now known as Technical Fellow.

Srivastava joined a strong Windows team in December 2003 as Vice President of the Core OS development to redefine the engineering process for Windows Vista, the new operating system from Microsoft. Srivastava was responsible for the development of core operating system components such as the kernel, operating system architecture, definition of development processes, and development of advanced tools to automate the development processes. Srivastava's work in defining the Windows engineering process was discussed in the Wall Street Journal in September 23, 2005.

After shipping Vista in November 2006, Srivastava and Dave Cutler joined Ray Ozzie to focus on next generation cloud services; to build an higly efficient computing fabric for Microsoft data centers and a services platform for agile development of high-quality cloud services.

Before working for Microsoft, Srivastava was the chief technical officer and vice president of engineering at TracePoint Technology Inc., a spin-off company from Digital Equipment Corp. He joined Digital's Western Research Labs (DEC WRL) in Palo Alto, Calif. in 1991. Srivastava's research on binary code modification at DEC WRL resulted in the creation of TracePoint. Srivastava started his career as a researcher at Texas Instruments Inc.'s Research Labs in Dallas, Texas. He left Pennsylvania State University's Computer Science PhD program to work on LISP Machines at Texas Instruments.

Srivastava holds 12 patents and has published a variety of papers. His paper on ATOM in PLDI 1994 received the Most Influential PLDI Paper Award in June 2005. He is the author of OM, ATOM and SCOOPS software systems, which have resulted in products for Digital Equipment and Texas Instruments on the Alpha and PC platforms. He led the design and development of Vulcan, a second-generation binary transformation system, at Microsoft. Vulcan is the foundation of a wide variety of tools developed at PPRC.

Srivastava holds a bachelor's degree in [bsmajor]Electrical Engineering[/bsmajor] from the [bsuniv]Indian Institute of Technology[/bsuniv], Kanpur, India, and a master's degree in [msmajor]Computer Science[/msmajor] from [msuniv]Pennsylvania State University[/msuniv]. He received the 2003-2004 Distinguished Alumnus Award from the Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur, and was selected the 2004 Outstanding Engineering Alumnus of the Pennsylvania State University.[/introduction]
