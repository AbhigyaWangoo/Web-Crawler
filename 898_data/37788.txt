Miscellaneous

After hard working for one and a half years in VU, I got a job finally in the first day of this Chinese New Year, a really lucky day for me. I will move to Parallel and Distributed Systems Group, Delft Unversity of Technology in July. A new life is waiting for me, with lots of smart people, lots of challenges and lots of fun :-)

The Dept. of Computer Science of the VU is famous for Minix, CVS and many others, so I come here. This is a wise decision for me, I believe. Indeed, I am satisified with the research environment and enjoy the life here. There is a new Masters Degree in Parallel and Distributed Computer Systems. Welcome to join us!

Before I came to Amsterdam, I had got my bachelor degree from the Department of [bsmajor]Computer Science[/bsmajor], [bsuniv]Sichuan University[/bsuniv], P. R. China, and been a research assistant for one year. My hometown is Songbai, a small and peace town by the Xiangjiang River, in Hengyang City, Hunan Province. I spent wonderful 17 years there.

In China, people always put their family name before their given name. Actually my family name is Yang (pronounced like "Young") , and my given name is Jie (pronounced like the English letter "J"). You can call me Jack if you like. You can find many of my photos here.

Actually, I am one of participants of the double degree program between 3 Chinese universities with VU. The other two universities are Wuhuan University and Jilin University. My coordinators are Guan Ping in the International Office of SCU, and Marieke te Booij in the International Office of VU (our picture).

Amsterdam is a very nice city, not too big and not too small. It's very suitable for living, somewhat like Chengdu, where I spent my unfogetable campus life for 5 years.

I like travel, basketball, football, movies, music, cook, making friends, writing essays, playing computer games, programming, and many others. Life is so colorful; why not enjoy it?

To know more about me, please visit the Chinese pages. Thanks for your concern.
