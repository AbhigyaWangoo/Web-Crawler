[resinterests]Research Interests

My general areas of interest are databases and information systems. Currently I am focusing on the following topics:

[interests]Cayuga[/interests]: [interests]Managing Data Streams[/interests]

We have developed novel techniques for addressing resource constraints in data stream management systems [DGR03, DGR05], including an optimal offline algorithm, hardness results, and efficient heuristics. We also developed an approach for fast approximation of aggregate queries over spatial data [DGR04]. This technique can be used for highly accurate selectivity estimation in spatial databases. It's main advantage over previous work in the area is that approximation quality guarantees (confidence intervals) are returned to the user.

Currently we are focusing on building highly scalable data stream processing systems. This includes the design of novel query languages with formal semantics [DGHRW06]. The goal is to find a sweet spot where we can achieve both expressiveness and scalable implementation. The resulting stream processor will be part of the Cornell Knowledge Broker system.

[interests]eScience[/interests]: [interests]Data Management and Analysis Services for the Sciences[/interests]

I have collaborated with scientists from different areas since 1999. As a graduate student I designed new summarization techniques for digital libraries, e.g., [RAE01, RAE01b]. In recent collaborations with physicists at SLAC and Cornell's Wilson Lab the emphasis was on mining high-energy physics data and on managing metadata and provenance for elementary particle physics. Our ongoing collaboration with the Cornell Astronomy department is surveyed in [CCD+04]. Data flow challenges for managing and analyzing astronomy data, elementary particle physics, and snapshots of the WWW are discussed in [AAC+06]. We recently started working with researchers in Cornell's Sibley School of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering. The goal of this collaboration is to improve the performance of long-running complex simulations of combustions [PRPG+06].

Since September 2004 I am co-PI on an NSF ITR award whose goal is to develop novel approaches for tracking environmental change based on bird abundance data. Currently we are mining a wealth of citizen science data hosted by Cornell's Lab of Ornithology in order to determine the abundance of wild bird species in North America. This will enable us to generate accurate abundance maps and to discover abundance patterns and patterns of seasonal and irruptive movements. In the next phase we will search for relationships between environmental change and changes in bird populations.

[interests]Hilda[/interests]: [interests]Building Data-Driven Web Applications[/interests]

An important class of applications are data-driven web applications, i.e., web applications that run on top of a back-end database system. Examples of such applications include online shopping sites, online auctions, and business-to-business portals. While developing data-driven web applications is a complex and challenging task, the application development interface provided by existing platforms is often too low-level or does not provide a unified model for the whole application stack. We are working on a novel high-level language, Hilda, for developing data-driven web applications [YSRGD05]. One result of this effort is a proof-of-concept compiler, which translates a Hilda program into executable J2EE code. The latest version of this compiler generates code, which automatically adapts the distribution of functionality between client and server to improve performance [GYD+06].

[interests]Data Warehousing[/interests]

Until recently my main research had concentrated on data warehousing, in particular on efficient aggregation and summarization techniques (see list of publications). I am still active in the area, but due to time constraints I am only focusing on active and real-time data warehousing, which are closely related to data stream management (see above).[/resinterests]
