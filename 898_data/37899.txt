Teaching Experience

  * CSE 380: Operating Systems (Fall 2002) Served as a teaching assistant for an undergraduate course on the introduction to operating systems. Held office hours and graded assignments and exams.

  * CSE 401: Senior Design Projects (Spring 2003) Organized the first poster day for the Computer Science and Engineering Department by coordinating 40+ undergraduate senior design projects, assigning six judges, and arranging five awards. Other duties included scheduling students' presentations throughout the semester.

  * CSE 372: Digital System Organization and Design Lab (Spring 2001) Advised students on designing and implementing circuits using Xilinx and FPGAs to construct an ALU and other CPU components culminating in a complete 16-bit integer pipelined CPU.
