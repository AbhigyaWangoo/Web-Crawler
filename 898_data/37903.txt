Professional Activities

[resinterests]<b> Research</b>

I belong to the [affiliation]Theoretical Computer Science Group[/affiliation].  My major research areas include [interests]computational geometry[/interests], [interests]algorithms[/interests], and [interests]data structures[/interests].  I am currently interested in [interests]algorithmic problems in geometric modeling[/interests].  Recently, I spend most of my time on problems in mesh generation and manifold reconstruction.  Mesh generation is an important task in numerical simulations in scientific and engineering applications.  In manifold reconstruction, I study curve and surface reconstruction from noisy samples, as well as manifold reconstruction in arbitrary dimensions.[/resinterests]

<b>Students</b>

I am working with one Ph.D. student Yajun Wang. I am also working with several undergraduate students on implementing some of the algorithms that we designed. My former PhD student Sheung-Hung Poon did a thesis on curve and surface reconstruction from noisy samples.

<b>Teaching</b>

I teach the following course in Fall 2006:

COMP 271H Design and Analysis of Algorithms (Honors Track)

I have taught the following courses before:

COMP 300B Introduction to Computational Geometry

COMP 171 Data Structures and Their Algorithms

COMP 271 Design and Analysis of Algorithms

COMP 573 Computational Geometry
