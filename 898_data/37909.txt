Cornell

My official title is "Research Supp Spec III". I have no idea why there's a III attached, but I'm sure Cornell has a very good reason for it.

[introduction]Basically, I'm a [position]research programmer[/position] for the [affiliation]Cornell DB Group[/affiliation]. I did my undergraduate and masters programs at [msuniv]Cornell[/msuniv], so I've been here a long, long time.[/introduction]
