Research Activities

I am interested in learning from data. The models and methods I use are inspired by work in the fields of statistics and data analysis, machine learning, probability theory, decision theory, decision analysis, and artificial intelligence. My recent work has concentrated on using graphical models for data analysis and visualization as well as methods for learning such models from data.
