[introduction]  I am a [position]professor[/position] of the [affiliation]Department of Computer Science, Shanghai Jiaotong University (SJTU)[/affiliation]. Currently I am serving as the [position]Departmental chairman[/position] and the [position]dean[/position] of the [affiliation]School of Software[/affiliation]. I am also the [position]director[/position] of [affiliation]BASICS, the Laboratory for the <b>Ba</b>sic <b>S</b>tudies in <b>C</b>omputing <b>S</b>cience[/affiliation], supported by the Shanghai Education Commission. My research interest is in [interests]theoretical computer science[/interests], [interests]focusing mainly on the concurrency theory[/interests], [interests]the type theory[/interests] and the [interests]related issues in formal method[/interests]. The evolution of my research interest can be seen from the list of my publications. Almost all the collaborators of these publications are my former and present PhD students. Our research effort has come up with results in type theory and its semantics, χ-Calculus, π-Calculus and Ambient Calculus. My present research work is supported by the projects from MIST and NNSFC.

  I am an [position]executive member[/position] of the [affiliation]Asian Association for Foundation of Software (AAFOS)[/affiliation]. I am also involved in a number of other professional activities.

  My teaching duty includes normally one postgraduate course per semester.[/introduction]

  <b>Teaching Duty</b>

  I normally teach one postgraduate course every semester. Over the years my courses have covered subjects on λ-calculus, domain theory, modal logic, concurrency theory, non-well-founded set theory, type theory and mathematical logics.

  I am teaching concurrency theory this semester. The course is scheduled at 6 PM every Thursday in the lecture room D404.
