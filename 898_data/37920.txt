[introduction]I am an [position]Associate Professor[/position] in the [affiliation]Theory of Computation Group , Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab[/affiliation]. I moved in here from the [phdmajor]Computer Science[/phdmajor] Department, [phduniv]Stanford University[/phduniv], where I finished my [phddegree]Ph.D.[/phddegree] by defending this thing. See my bio for more information.[/introduction]


News: Check out our new web page on the new LSH algorithm and code.
